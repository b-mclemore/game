roadmap

[X] render a tick counter
[X] render a room
[X] render a character that can move
[X] render start screen w/ fonts
[X] refactor code (src/include, split up gamestates)
[X] fix resizing
[X] add second screen for text/menu (GameStateMain holds GameStateVisual and GameStateTextual)
    text can be static for now
[X] on tab, pause GameStateVisual and move to text
[X] when paused, text entry is enabled
[X] console typing rendering, handle "quit" or "q" to quit. toLowerCase everything.
[ ] reset line when buffer circles

[ ] render an enemy
[ ] the enemy moves once every two ticks
[ ] when the enemy reaches the character, transition to new GameStateVisual
[ ] visual transition between GameState (game modules)

screen should be split always
left screen is game, right is "console" (text)
tab between screens, pauses left on tab
GameState classes for each game/minigame/etc
