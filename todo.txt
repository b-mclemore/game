roadmap

[X] render a tick counter
[X] render a room
[X] render a character that can move
[X] render start screen w/ fonts
[ ] refactor code (src/include, split up gamestates)
[ ] add second screen for text/menu (GameStateMain holds GameStateVisual and GameStateTextual)
    text can be static for now

[ ] render an enemy
[ ] the enemy moves once every two ticks
[ ] on tab, pause GameStateVisual and move to text
[ ] when paused, text entry is enabled
[ ] when the enemy reaches the character, transition to new GameStateVisual
[ ] fix resizing
[ ] visual transition between GameState (game modules)

screen should be split always
left screen is game, right is "console" (text)
tab between screens, pauses left on tab
GameState classes for each game/minigame/etc

font steps
1. create font atlas (use 16x16 ascii for initial)
2. create font struct (texture, width, height)
3. take text and call drawSprite on each character
