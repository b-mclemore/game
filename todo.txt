roadmap

[X] render a tick counter
[X] render a room
[X] render a character that can move
[X] render start screen w/ fonts
[X] refactor code (src/include, split up gamestates)
[X] fix resizing
[X] add second screen for text/menu (GameStateMain holds GameStateVisual and GameStateTextual)
    text can be static for now
[X] on tab, pause GameStateVisual and move to text
[X] when paused, text entry is enabled
[X] console typing rendering, handle "quit" or "q" to quit. toLowerCase everything.
[X] reset line when buffer circles
[X] add delete for buffer
[X] other color for system addLines
[X] add placeholders GameStateHelp and GameStateSettings for the opening menu
[X] render a second character
[X] on interaction w/ character, switch to textual and print tutorial message
[X] Make text render colors more neat
[X] Fix "add line" to handle multi-line adds

[X] remove spriterenderer and make all sprites drawn from an atlas
[X] remove geometry renderer
[X] fix uv errors for atlas w single-sprite
[X] npc class, npc list for map
[X] render a third character
[X] fix npc interaction handling
[X] on interaction w/ character, switch visual gamemode to chessboard
[X] abstract the left-side rendering more from the main class (the large switch statements everywhere,
    e.g. checking if Visual or Chess in draw, update, handle, etc)
[X] abstract the rendering more from the gamestate_visual class (drawPlayer, drawMap, etc)
[X] simplify movement handling, create new fn
[ ] chess puzzle gamestate class -> draw board, read fen, handle gameover

[ ] animate character moving
[ ] fix collision (maybe have a list or a second map)
[ ] better floor/wall textures
[ ] only re-draw changed textures?
[ ] make npc face character on interaction

[ ] handle up arrow on console
[ ] empty command "" after interacting w/ character should switch context back
[ ] rework rendering to use a single renderer with global grid to handle resizing?
    can use sprite atlas of 8x8 sprites
[ ] maths speedups?

screen should be split always
left screen is game, right is "console" (text)
tab between screens, pauses left on tab
GameState classes for each game/minigame/etc
