roadmap

[X] render a tick counter
[X] render a room
[X] render a character that can move
[X] render start screen w/ fonts
[X] refactor code (src/include, split up gamestates)
[X] fix resizing
[X] add second screen for text/menu (GameStateMain holds GameStateVisual and GameStateTextual)
    text can be static for now
[X] on tab, pause GameStateVisual and move to text
[X] when paused, text entry is enabled
[X] console typing rendering, handle "quit" or "q" to quit. toLowerCase everything.
[X] reset line when buffer circles
[X] add delete for buffer
[X] other color for system addLines
[X] add placeholders GameStateHelp and GameStateSettings for the opening menu

[X] render a second character
[X] on interaction w/ character, switch to textual and print tutorial message
[ ] empty command "" after interacting w/ character should switch context back

[ ] Make text render colors more neat
[ ] Fix "add line" to handle multi-line adds
[ ] fix map rendering, simplify. see below

[ ] render a third character
[ ] on interaction w/ character, switch visual gamemode to chessboard
[ ] visual transition between GameState (game modules), e.g. a fade in/out

[ ] handle up arrow on console
[ ] rework rendering to use a single renderer with global grid to handle resizing?
    can use sprite atlas of 8x8 sprites
[ ] maths speedups?

screen should be split always
left screen is game, right is "console" (text)
tab between screens, pauses left on tab
GameState classes for each game/minigame/etc
