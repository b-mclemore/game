roadmap

[X] render a tick counter
[X] render a room
[X] render a character that can move
[X] render start screen w/ fonts
[X] refactor code (src/include, split up gamestates)
[X] fix resizing
[X] add second screen for text/menu (GameStateMain holds GameStateVisual and GameStateTextual)
    text can be static for now
[X] on tab, pause GameStateVisual and move to text
[X] when paused, text entry is enabled
[X] console typing rendering, handle "quit" or "q" to quit. toLowerCase everything.
[X] reset line when buffer circles
[X] add delete for buffer
[X] other color for system addLines
[X] add placeholders GameStateHelp and GameStateSettings for the opening menu
[X] render a second character
[X] on interaction w/ character, switch to textual and print tutorial message
[X] Make text render colors more neat
[X] Fix "add line" to handle multi-line adds

[X] remove spriterenderer and make all sprites drawn from an atlas
[X] remove geometry renderer
[X] fix uv errors for atlas w single-sprite
[X] npc class, npc list for map
[X] render a third character
[X] fix npc interaction handling
[X] on interaction w/ character, switch visual gamemode to chessboard
[X] abstract the left-side rendering more from the main class (the large switch statements everywhere,
    e.g. checking if Visual or Chess in draw, update, handle, etc)
[X] abstract the rendering more from the gamestate_visual class (drawPlayer, drawMap, etc)
[X] simplify movement handling, create new fn
[X] chess puzzle gamestate class -> draw board, read fen
[X] add movelist
[X] add console interaction
[X] handle correct/incorrect moves
[ ] add move animation (skip handleInput while animating)

[X] animate character moving
[X] fix collision (maybe have a list or a second map)
[X] make npc face character on interaction
[X] handle npc rendering and player rendering with the same abstract fn
[X] better floor/wall textures
[X] fix rendering - seems like sprites are being shrunk (player feet should be hidden behind npcs taller than 16 pxs)
[ ] floor/wall orientations - add sides/corners as a sprite atlas
[ ] rework map renderer, abstract more things (e.g. tiletype switching)

[ ] handle up arrow on console
[ ] empty command "" after interacting w/ character should switch context back
[ ] rm duplicate code
[ ] sprite batching
[ ] add mouse controls for chess

screen should be split always
left screen is game, right is "console" (text)
tab between screens, pauses left on tab
GameState classes for each game/minigame/etc

on character interaction, switch to Textual. An empty return or tab will return to the visual. OR you can
continue interacting with text commands
