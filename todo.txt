roadmap

[X] render a tick counter
[X] render a room
[X] render a character that can move
[ ] render start screen w/ fonts
[ ] add second screen for text/menu
[ ] render an enemy
[ ] the enemy moves once every two ticks
[ ] when the enemy reaches the character, transition to other screen
[ ] fix resizing

[ ] transition between GameState (game modules)

screen should be split always
left screen is game, right is "console" (text)
tab between screens, pauses left on tab
GameState classes for each game/minigame/etc

font steps
1. create font atlas (use 16x16 ascii for initial)
2. create font struct (texture, width, height)
3. take text and call drawSprite on each character
